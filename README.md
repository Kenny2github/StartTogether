# This bot no longer runs
Discord's "Activities" (which replaced the "Together" terminology) can now be started directly from within voice channels and have additional controls over who can start them (e.g. Nitro). This bot hasn't been functional for a while and is also entirely obsolete, so it has been discontinued. The original README is preserved below.

# StartTogether
A very barebones bot that creates invites to various "Together" apps.

Type `/start` and read descriptions.
